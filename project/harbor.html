            <h2>Pearl Harbor</h2>
            <p>There is so much to do at Pearl Harbor. It is a fully day of fun! I went out to the Arizona Memorial, a very solemn place. Members of the Navy take you out on a ferry to the Memorial where you can see a list of names of those that died there. I also saw a kind of fish I have never seen before. I also went on the ship, the Missouri. They give you a map and you can walk the entire ship! It was huge! I also had the chance to see a submarine come in from deployment, which is a super rare occurance. I also learned Pearl Harbor is still a major working Navy yard, so you have to be careful what you take pictures of and where. They also had a submarine you can walk through, but I ran out of time for that. They also have an airfield we got to go see. They have a lot of different planes there. One awesome thing I saw was the windows in the hangars. At first I didn't notice them, but the original bullet holes from the attack are still there!</p>
